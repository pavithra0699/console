Approach: The length of the array is n-1. So the sum of all n elements, i.e sum of numbers from 1 to n can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. Now find the sum of all the elements in the array and subtract it from the sum of first n natural numbers, it will be the value of the missing element.
 
 
 Algorithm: 
Calculate the sum of first n natural numbers as sumtotal= n*(n+1)/2
Create a variable sum to store the sum of array elements.
Traverse the array from start to end.
Update the value of sum as sum = sum + array[i]
Print the missing number as sumtotal â€“ sum
